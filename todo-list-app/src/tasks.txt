Improvements to make:
1. if user clicks on menu button and width is for mobile then add the overlay and change animation
2. Have a separate add task button form dropdown close to nav bar add button - instead of using the one from the bottom
3. set z-index of add form greater than left side menu
4. if a project and its contents are delete - update inbox
5. Add email/pwd authentication 
    - Also password reset
6. Display pop up message if user adds a new task in todays bin with date not set to todays
    - say task can be found in inbox cuz its date isn't todays
8. Change default projects and their ids (generated by elsewhere) from uuid generator
9. If complete make them opaque and add line through 
    - this distinguishes completed tasks vs. deleted tasks
    - potential way to implement is to add a completed property to each todo card object (boolean)
10. Should maybe update inbox if a task in a project bin is deleted/complete 
11. Maybe allow user to change name of project
12. Change initial on profile - editable
    - maybe even upload profile pic
13. Add bins selector on AddTaskForm to allow users the ability to select which bin to place in
14. Persistent data per user account - using firebase FireStore
15. Change date color for overdue todos
16. Add a section for this weeks todos 
17. Add filter todo cards button (based on priority or recent date)
18. Maybe change description to be a textarea on both add/editTaskForms
19. Decide what default todo cards to display when user 1st logs in
20. Password reset abilities
21. Add loading spinner in between routing and when first loading page
=======================================================================
Improvements currently working on:
7. Change inbox id to 'app/inbox' and make it the home page not today
